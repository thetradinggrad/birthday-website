      <p>Happy Birthday, Samriddhi ❤️

On your special day, I want to begin not just with love, but with honesty.

I’m sorry.
Samriddhi, you are my favorite person in this world. I know I’ve made many mistakes, especially over the past year. I didn’t give you the time, attention, or love you deserved. I was so focused on academics, so caught up in trying to secure a future for us, that I forgot to be present in the moments that truly mattered—with you.

As a boyfriend, I failed to give you what you needed emotionally. I thought once COMEDK ended and things settled down, we’d finally have our time together. But in that wait, I ignored your words, especially when you tried to tell me how distant we had become. I never truly believed you'd walk away... until you did.

And I broke.

I know my ego and attitude came in the way, and I hate myself for that. Not just because I lost you—but because I hurt the one person who only ever wished the best for me. I feel guilty, and I carry that guilt every day.

Please believe me when I say this: I love you so much. You’ve never had to feel insecure about how I see you—I’ve only ever wanted the best for you, and I never could think badly of you. Never.

Samriddhi, if there’s even a small space left in your heart for me, I’m asking you—please come back. I promise I’ll be better. I’ll be the kind of boyfriend you deserve. You mean the world to me, and without you, everything feels incomplete.

So on your birthday, I wish you happiness, love, and all the beautiful things life has to offer—and I truly hope I can be a part of that again.

I’m sorry. I love you. And I miss you. Happy Birthday, my love. 🎂💖💞</p>
      <p>i-love-you 🎉🎂💖 Enjoy your day my girl </p>
